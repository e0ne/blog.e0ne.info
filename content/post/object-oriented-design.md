It’s mostly a reminder to myself that it’s a time to read this book again.

I the past, when I used C# instead of Python in my daily job, I read a lot of
books about object-oriented programming and design, patterns and software
architecture. C# like a Java is object-oriented programming language. It means
you have to create objects for everything. It seems very heavyweight, so I
switched to Python.

Since then I don’t like OOP. Mostly because it leads to more code. I don’t like
it but I have to use it because of OOP and OOD could help to implement cleaner
code. I read the “Object-Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications” book
by Grady Booch about ten years ago and it helped me to understand all the pros
and cons of this approach.

I think it’s time for me to read this book again to refresh my memory about
object-oriented design.
