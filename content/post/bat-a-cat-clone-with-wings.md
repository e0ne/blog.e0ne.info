Finally switched from cat, less and vim (omg!) for reading files in a console.
If you still didn’t try [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) it’s the right
time to try it. It’s a powerful CLI tool which works like cat+less out of the
box, has syntax highlight like vim (honestly, I used vim to view file contents
just because it has syntax highlight), supports themes and is configurable,
so you can tune it as you want.

It’s the most amazing CLI tool I’ve found during the last year.
