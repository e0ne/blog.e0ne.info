Fighting with tests during the last two days, I would like to drop a short note
of why I usually do this job.

First of all, it’s a great chance to understand how the project works. Even if
test coverage is not good enough, usually you can learn a lot about project
architecture.

The next reason is that almost every project team doesn’t have enough time to
improve or extend the current tests. Test-driven development helps a bit with
unit tests coverage, but it doesn’t require any other tests to be implemented
first. I’m not talking about QA practices here, I’m talking from the developers
perspective. Slow unit tests or too complicates integration tests could be
found to improve in any project.


Last, but not least: it’s a challenge to get tests faster and increase tests
coverage.
