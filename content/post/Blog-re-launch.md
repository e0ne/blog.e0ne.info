After more or less technical blog I’m ready to say it’s successfully re-launched. I hope, it’ll be interesting to read.

I’m going to blog about the following topics this year:

* Python
* OpenStack
* Linux
* JavaScript (Vue.js and React.js)
* etc.

I’ll try to publish new posts regularly and make them interesting to read.

Enjoy the reading!
