It was some kind on New Year challenge for me to write a post every day.
Something went good, something not but I feel pretty good on this initiative
and want to continue. It’s really hard to post something every day. I started
to post some notes that don’t feet into Twitter’s limit. There are a lot of
drafts in progress so I’ll try post more technical things next month.

Stay tuned.

P.S. I think it’s time to enable comments so I’ll find some time this weekend
to do it.
