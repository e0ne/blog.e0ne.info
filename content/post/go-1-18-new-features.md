While it’s not release yet, it’s just a reminder to myself to not forget come back to it in February and read about these features:

- [Fuzzing library](https://golang.org/issue/44551) - should be useful for everybody who writes unit-tests. I don’t  like tests in Go but this thing could help a lot
- net/netip package - this is a definitely good thing to have it in a standard library
- New `go get` behaviour - nothing critical but the new features should be adopted
- Generics - I think almost everybody waits for it. They should help to avoid a lot of duplicated code. I hope, it will be at least the so good as in .NET

Official release notes got Go 1.18 could be found [here](https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.18)
