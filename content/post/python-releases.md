Since I switched to Python 3.5 as my default and I need to keep backward compatibility with Python 2.7 one year more, I don’t follow new features and releases a lot. Originally, Python 3.5 was released about 3.5 years ago. Looking throw release notes, I think I’ll switch to Python 3.6 just for the projects where I don’t need to support 2.7. There are not a lot of features in newer releases but some of them seem to be useful for me.

Honestly, I spent too much time with Python 2.7 only, so I don’t know if one minor release per year is good or not. Of course, it’s not an issue for new, not enterprise projects. But it’s too many releases for long-running enterprise projects like OpenStack:(.

As a reminder for myself, here are Python releases dates and release notes:
