Software development often looks like a puzzle assembling. You need to fit a few pieces together to make something working.

It’s OK when you need to create something fast. Like a new web site on an existing engine with several new features. There are a lot of libraries, frameworks, engines almost for any case.

I’m happy that I still can create something new. Something I can’t google about. Something nobody asked and answered on StackOverflow. There are a lot of interesting and hard tasks to resolve which I can resolve with software engineering skills.
