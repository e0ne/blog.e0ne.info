Open source software is not free. Sometimes it’s not cheap at all. It even
could be more expensive than some proprietary software with any high price.

I like Open Source. I use it. I contribute to some open source project even on
my personal time. But you must know, that price for the open source software
could be very high.

You always need to think about how many time do you spend during
troubleshooting/deploying/fixing or improving some open source software. It
could take a lot of time for it. Sometimes it’s better and cheaper than open
source.

There are a lot of open sources software I use. I try to use them because I
want to keep my money with me. I do contribute to some projects I like. I do
donate too. But I’m ready to switch to any commercial software if it makes my
life easier. I don’t want to support awful software just because it’s cheap.

I don’t want to advertise any software in this post, so I don’t put any names
here. Just, please, *remember*: Open Source software is not free. It could be
cheap, but usually, you pay a too high price for it.
