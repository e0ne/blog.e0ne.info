A short Friday’s holy war about IDEs, text editors and vim:). I don’t really
like bikeshedding about text editors, but I was asked about my favorite one too
much to not drop a note here.

I spent most of the time in editors with Python code, a bit less with
JavaScript/TypeScript. Of course, a lot of json and yaml, sometimes bash
scripts and Ansible playbooks are opened by me too. I strongly believe that for
each task there is the best tool somewhere. All-in-one tools are line swiss
knife: they are useful to by by the hand, but it’s not so comfortable to work
with day by day.

I use these tools almost every day: Vim, PyCharm, and SublimeText2.

I spent a lot of time with SublimeText2 as my main editor instead of a normal
IDE. It works pretty well if I install dozens of plugins for all my needs.
Sometimes plugins work good, sometimes they work extremely slow with crashes
every 10 minutes, so I need to spend some time to find a new plugin because of
the old one abandoned by maintainer(s). I use it now mostly when I need to open
and edit a few files quickly.

I tried to work with Atom and Code. It sucks. I do not like Electron-based
desktop software at all. I try to not use it wherever it’s possible. They are
too slow and require too many resources. PyCharm works with the same speed on
my laptop. In the same time, PyCharm provides a lot of great features I really
like and use. IDE isn’t just a text editor with a debugger inside. I didn’t
find such a powerful code search, navigation, refactoring, and so on. Really,
I spent enough time to configure Vim and Sublime but all of plugins don’t
provide such comfort as PyCharm out of the box. The main drawback of the
PyCharm for me it’s UI. I really like Sublime’s UI more. But it’s pretty good
to use it every day without any issues.

Vim. I use it for two reasons: on remove hosts and if I need edit some file
and I’m already working with the terminal. Almost any environment I work with
contains Vim. Sometimes it’s only one existing editor and I can’t install
anything else. That’s why I have to use it. Also, I use it sometimes for minor
text edit inside the terminal window because it’s a faster way to do it. Also,
I use Vim as my editor for git.

Emacs. I didn’t play with it enough. I think that Vim cover all my needs.
