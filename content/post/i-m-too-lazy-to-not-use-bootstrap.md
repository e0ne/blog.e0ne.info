I never liked hit with CSS. I hate to deal with HTML make up a lot. I prefer to work with JavaScript and omit styles if possible. Maybe it’s only because I’m not an expert in this area.

That’s why I use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework where it’s possible. It allows everybody to create pretty good UI’s for web application with minimal knowledge of styles and CSS.

In a real word, I don’t even want to use Bootstrap directly in web applications based on modern libraries and frameworks like [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). These tools force you to use components instead of code and layout duplication. There are great projects like [Bootstrap + Vue](https://bootstrap-vue.js.org/) and [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) which do all wrapping around Bootstrap to provide us ready to use components.

I didn’t find anything for using custom HTML tags as Bootstrap components but I don’t need it now. Maybe it’s easier to create such library by hands.

There are a lot of other CSS frameworks like [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) which is used for this blog and you can find ready to use React/Vue/Angular components for them. What I want to say you with this post, is that CSS framework are almost ‘must have thing’ for modern websites and there is a big ecosystem around them. We should not waste our time by implementing standard components. We can use existing and implement more interesting things.
