NOTE: I didn’t google definition either for ‘library’ nor for ‘framework’ for
years. I even didn’t read Wikipedia articles during the last 3-5 years. That
means that thoughts are my own, so you could disagree with me.

For me, the difference between a library and a framework is in architecture
freedom.

A framework provides you a skeleton for your project with some basic
architecture. It would be a low-level architecture like ‘how to work with IO’
or a high-level MVC implementation. Each framework provides you a very limited
number of solutions for a particular problem. It benefits you in a good
structure for each project based on the chosen framework. If you do not
with a proposed way to follow, in most cases it leads to a pretty hacky and
complicated solution.

On the other hand, the library gives you much more freedom. You can choose an
architecture which fits best your needs. It just provides some APIs which you
can use as you want. It means any project with some library will be different
from the previous one.

Sometimes it’s useful to build a framework on top of the library to use it.
There are a lot of good examples. You can build your own framework based on
existing too. Both of these ways have own pros and cons like any tool you use.

No conclusion from me this time. I just need some link with these definitions
to be able to share them.
