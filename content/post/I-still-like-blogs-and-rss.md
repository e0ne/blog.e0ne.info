RSS is a great thing for news and blog reading. It’s good structured (not like
a Facebook), contains everything needed (do you really like threads in
Twitter?) and has good enough tools for offline reading during flights or a
train ride (that’s why Telegram channels don’t fit my needs.

RSS gives you a lot of freedom on what content do you want to receive and
doesn’t force you to read it right at this moment because you won’t be able to
find this later. I use Feedly+Pocket to read what and where I want.

I also use my own blog as a wiki to make notes which I’m able to find in the
future. So it’s one more cause while I’m blogging instead of posting everything
into Facebook or Telegram.
