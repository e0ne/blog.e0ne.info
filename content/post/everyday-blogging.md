After 2.5 months I'm thinking about wrap up the everyday blogging activity. It
was an interesting challenge. It helped me to restore a blog. But it’s really
hard for me to do such things on a daily basis. I prefer quality instead of
quantity. That means I need more time to write more interesting posts. I don’t
know how I’ll do it in the future but I hope you’ll get more interesting posts
soon.
