NOTE: There is a new format for my posts. Something like really short reviews.
I call it ‘notes’. I’ll publish such posts time to time to share something
great with you and to not lost links to them.

Somebody likes everything in Docker/container principle, somebody doesn’t. I
like this idea more and more each day. I even think that I started looking into
the containers too late.

Nevertheless, I move a lot of services to Docker just because it’s easier than
having 10-15-20+ repos in my apt.sources and get everything working on a single
PC. I think the next big thing for me is to build home Kubernetes cluster. But
it’s a totally different story.

Since containerization could take a lot of time, I’ve found a great collection
of Docker images. I’m leaving the link here to not forget:
