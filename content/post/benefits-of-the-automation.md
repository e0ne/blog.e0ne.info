Nobody will argue that Automation is great. I hope it’s obvious for everybody.
Even simple automation which saves you a few minutes every day helps a lot to
not do some boring routing things.

Since I created some simple scripts to publish new blog posts, create
containers or virtual machines for required environments, it saves me a lot of
time to do something interesting or read about new technologies which I can or
even cannot bring to my current projects.

I’ve got a strong rule now: if there is something I have to do at least three
times, I’ll spend a time to automate it. Usually, it takes less time to
automate something than repeat all steps every day.
