I don’t want to argue about necessary of code review now. It’s to each team to
specify rules on how to do it. I just want to share with you my opinion why do
we need it on each project.

- First of all, it’s about code knowledge sharing. It’s a great chance to share
knowledge about the project with a team. More code reviews you do - more
knowledge about the project you’ve got.
- To learn something new. New practices, approaches, etc - you may know a lot
of interesting doing the code review.
- To be on the same page with a team. More code reviews mean more
communications between team members. It helps you to understand what the team
expects from you and how to write good code for the particular project. It’s
kind of formal type of communications which helps to build a good Team.
