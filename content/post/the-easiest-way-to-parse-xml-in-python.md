I would like to add this as a note here. I really hope that we will not use XML
anymore in the nearest future but in case if somebody needs it, you have to use
untangle. [untangle](https://github.com/stchris/untangle) is awesome pure
python library to parse XML withoud pain. You just need to try if if XML still
exists in your world.
