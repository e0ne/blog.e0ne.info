Nobody likes boring and routine tasks at all. It’s a good idea to do something
interesting and challenging each day. I’m sure that you can find such a task on
any kind of job you have. You just need to find 5-10 minutes for it and you’ll
find something interesting to do.

I failed today. Only boring ad routine tasks during the day. I’ll do my best to
fix this tomorrow and post something interesting for you.
