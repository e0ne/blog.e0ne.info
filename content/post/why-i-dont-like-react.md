I wanted to name this post as ‘pros and cons of React’, but I didn’t find good
benefits that would push me to use this library.

One thing I like that it tries to promote reactive programming, but it does it
not really good, IMO. I like Rxjs and I really think that there are a lot of
great things which could be borrowed from Rxjs to React to make it more
functional.

It’s a UI-centric library, not a framework. I still don’t understand why
somebody calls it ‘a framework’. It means that every new react-based project
will be different. I don’t want to argue about react+redux+something templates
because it doesn’t do a framework. I would like to see something like
Marionette for Backbone but with Ract.


I don’t like JSX at all. Really, I think that React should support something
else for templating. I don’t want to combine HTML with my JavaScript code. I
see only one small benefit of this: a bit less code.


**NOTE**: It’s only my opinion and you can disagree with me. I didn’t add any
link in this post, so if you want it’s easy to google a lot of information on
this topic and it will be a good amount of posts about pros and cons of react.
It’s just my opinion which I would like to share with you.
